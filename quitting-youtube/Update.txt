Hey everyone,

This is a message I never really thought Iâ€™d have to write â€” but here it is.

Iâ€™ve made the decision to step away from YouTube and hide my channel, at least for now. This isnâ€™t because I gave up, or because I lost motivation to create. Itâ€™s because of a recent change on YouTube thatâ€™s honestly making it hard for people like me to even participate.

YouTube has introduced new AI-powered systems that try to detect if youâ€™re under 18. If the system "thinks" you're a minor â€” even if youâ€™re just a young-looking creator or viewer â€” it can restrict your account or content in big ways. That means removing access to features like comments, live chat, notifications, community posts, and more.

Worse, it doesnâ€™t even ask for your actual age in many cases. It just guesses, often using things like your face, behavior, or activity. If it gets it wrong â€” too bad. Your content might be limited. Your audience might stop seeing your videos. And thereâ€™s not much you can do about it.

This isnâ€™t about safety anymore. It feels more like censorship. Creators who are under 18 â€” or just look young â€” are being silenced, limited, or made to feel like they donâ€™t belong on the platform. Itâ€™s not fair, and itâ€™s not how YouTube used to be.

I understand the importance of protecting kids online. But punishing teen creators or young-looking people who follow the rules isnâ€™t protection â€” itâ€™s control. Itâ€™s discouraging. It makes you feel like youâ€™re not welcome here.

So for now, Iâ€™m done with YouTube.

Iâ€™m still creating content, just on platforms that donâ€™t treat age like a reason to shut people out. You can find me on TikTok, Instagram, and more â€” all the links are here:

If YouTube ever changes this system and starts respecting creators again â€” I might come back. Until then, thank you all for watching, for your support, and for being part of the journey.

This isnâ€™t goodbye forever. Just goodbye for now.

â€” Obby
